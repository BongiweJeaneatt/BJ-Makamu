<!--Section 1: Introduce your self-->
## ABOUT ME

Hi, I’m Bongiwe Jeanett Makamu 👋
I am a final-year BSc student majoring in Chemistry and Computer Science, with a growing interest in Business Systems Analysis and Data Analytics.

I enjoy breaking down complex problems, understanding how systems work, and translating requirements into clear, structured solutions. Through academic projects and practical assignments, I have gained experience with SQL, HTML, UML diagrams, and process documentation.

In addition, I run a small home-based sublimation and printing business, which has strengthened my skills in organisation, stakeholder communication, and problem-solving.

I am currently building practical projects that showcase systems thinking, structured analysis, and data-driven problem-solving.
